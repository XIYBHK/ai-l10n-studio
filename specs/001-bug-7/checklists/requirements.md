# Specification Quality Checklist: 关键用户界面和功能问题修复

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2025-10-14  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

### ✅ All Quality Checks Passed

**Content Quality**:

- Specification focuses on user-facing behavior and value delivery
- No technical implementation details (no mention of React, Rust, Tauri commands)
- Written in clear language accessible to non-technical stakeholders
- All mandatory sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria) completed

**Requirement Completeness**:

- All 10 functional requirements are testable and unambiguous
- Success criteria include specific metrics (95% success rate, 100ms response time, etc.)
- Success criteria avoid technical jargon (e.g., "users complete task" vs "API responds")
- 6 user stories with complete acceptance scenarios (Given-When-Then format)
- 8 edge cases identified covering error scenarios and boundary conditions
- Scope clearly bounded to 7 specific bugs with priorities
- Assumptions section documents reasonable defaults

**Feature Readiness**:

- Each user story maps to specific functional requirements
- Acceptance scenarios provide clear test criteria
- Success criteria are measurable and verifiable
- No technical implementation leaked (properly focuses on WHAT not HOW)

## Notes

- Specification is ready for `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`
- All bugs prioritized: P1 (critical/blocking), P2 (UX issues), P3 (improvements)
- No clarifications needed - sufficient context from log analysis and user reports
- Validation completed in first iteration - no revisions required
